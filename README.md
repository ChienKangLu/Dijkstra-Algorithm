# Dijkstra-Algorithm
Dijkstra-Algorithm is a classical shortest path algorithm.

## Step
1. Initial all distance to infinity
2. Set start point whose distance between start point to 0
3. Find the smallest unknown distance vertex
4. If finding a better path, it will update the shortest-path length until now
